# ps2-DevKit
Complete PlayStation 2 Development Kit(I think) with SDK(old but it works), CD/DVD Generator, and PS2Link networking tools. Everything you need to develop homebrew applications and games(perhaps, I will still look at the issue of engines, see how renderware can be applied, but sdl is present) for PS2 in one package.
